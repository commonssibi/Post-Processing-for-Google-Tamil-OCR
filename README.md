# Post-Processing-for-Google-Tamil-OCR
**To be translated to Tamil whenever possible**

A project aimed at correcting mistakes in a Google Tamil OCR-ed file

As on 23rd September 2015 , the Google Tamil OCR is better than other proprietary OCR's . Though it is 
based on the Tesseract OCR engine which is under  Apache License, Version 2.0 , the code and enhancements of this is stil not known ;) . Hoping that Google would make the code open or in the best case Free ( as in freedom) at later point of time . The current attempt is to create a "post processing " mechanism to remove ambigutites and fill in the words , correct mistakes if present . 

The project can be split into 
1)Testing as many as documents as possible so that to create a standard repository of errors which occur .
